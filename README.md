# ProcessLens (VS Code)

üöÄ **Track and analyze build, test, and other process times to gain insights and iterate faster.** **Local-first** ‚Äî no data leaves your machine.

ProcessLens helps you identify performance bottlenecks, track trends over time, and optimize your development workflow by providing detailed analytics on command execution times.

## ‚ú® Features

### üìä **Comprehensive Dashboard**

- **Global Stats**: Total runs, commands tracked, success rate, and active projects
- **Recent Durations Chart**: Visual timeline of command execution times with hover details
- **Command Summary Table**: Detailed statistics with customizable columns
- **Recent Runs**: Last 10 command executions with trend indicators

### üìà **Advanced Analytics**

- **Statistical Insights**: Average, Median, P95, Min/Max execution times
- **7-Day Trend Analysis**: Track if commands are getting faster (‚Üò), slower (‚Üó), or stable (‚Üí)
- **Success Rate Monitoring**: Track command reliability over time
- **Hardware Change Detection**: Automatic annotations when your hardware configuration changes

### üî• **Impact Analysis - NEW!**

**Identify Your Biggest Time Sinks with Smart Calculations**

- **Total Time Column**: Shows cumulative time consumed (duration √ó frequency)
- **Impact Score**: Visual progress bar (0-100) showing relative impact compared to your most time-consuming command
- **Time/Day**: Average daily time consumption for workflow analysis
- **Beautiful Visualizations**: Color-coded impact bars with gradients (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red)

**How It Works:**

- **Smart Calculation**: Multiplies average duration by run frequency to find commands that consume the most total time
- **Relative Scoring**: Impact scores are calculated relative to your highest time-consuming command (100 = highest impact)
- **Optimization Priority**: Focus on high-impact commands first for maximum time savings
- **Daily Insights**: Understand how much time each command consumes in your daily workflow

**Example**: A command that runs 50 times at 2 seconds each (100s total) has higher impact than a command that runs 2 times at 30 seconds each (60s total).

### üîÆ **Performance Predictions - NEW!**

**Calculate Time Savings from Command Optimizations**

- **Projected Savings**: Estimates potential time savings if commands were optimized
- **Optimization Priority**: Smart scoring (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on multiple factors
- **ROI Analysis**: Helps prioritize which commands to optimize first
- **Trend Velocity**: Tracks if commands are getting faster or slower over time

**Smart Scoring Factors:**

- **Impact Score**: High-impact commands get higher optimization priority
- **Performance Trends**: Commands getting slower have higher priority
- **Variability**: Commands with inconsistent performance suggest optimization opportunities
- **Frequency**: Frequently-run commands have more optimization potential

**Conservative Estimates:**

- **HIGH Priority**: Assumes 30% improvement potential
- **MEDIUM Priority**: Assumes 15% improvement potential
- **LOW Priority**: Assumes 5% improvement potential

**Example**: A HIGH priority command running 100 times at 10s average could save ~5 minutes total if optimized by 30%.

### üéõÔ∏è **Interactive Features**

- **Customizable Columns**: Show/hide statistics columns via 3-dot menu (‚ãØ)
- **Trend Sparklines**: Mini charts showing recent performance trends
- **Clickable Analysis**: Click runs/success columns to filter recent runs
- **One-Click Re-run**: Play buttons (‚ñ∂) to instantly re-execute any command
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by project, command, time window, success status, and device

### üîß **Command Execution**

- **Shell History Integration**: Browse and execute commands from bash/zsh/fish history
- **Package.json Scripts**: Automatic discovery and execution of npm/yarn scripts
- **Custom Commands**: Run any shell command with full timing and status tracking
- **Multi-Project Support**: Track commands across different workspaces

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install ProcessLens from the VS Code Extensions marketplace
2. Open any workspace/project
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
4. Type "ProcessLens: Run Command" and select it
5. Choose a command to run and start tracking!

### Commands

- **ProcessLens: Run Command** ‚Äî Execute and time any command (package.json scripts, shell history, or custom)
- **ProcessLens: Open Dashboard** ‚Äî View your comprehensive performance analytics

### Quick Tips

üí° **Browse Shell History**: Select "üìú Browse Shell History" in the command picker to access your recent terminal commands

üí° **Package.json Scripts**: Your project's npm/yarn scripts are automatically discovered and available in the command picker

üí° **Column Customization**: Click the ‚ãØ button in Command Summary to show/hide statistical columns

üí° **Trend Analysis**: Enable the "Trend" column to see 7-day performance trends at a glance

üí° **Hardware Tracking**: ProcessLens automatically detects hardware changes and marks them on your charts

## üìä Dashboard Guide

### Global Stats (Top Bar)

- **Total Runs**: Number of commands executed
- **Commands Tracked**: Unique commands monitored
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Active Projects**: Number of different projects/workspaces

### Chart Features

- **Color-coded dots**: Green (success), Red (failure), Yellow (unknown)
- **Hardware annotations**: Vertical lines marking hardware changes
- **Interactive tooltips**: Hover for command details and execution info
- **Hover legend**: Detailed command information appears below chart

### Command Summary Table

- **Default columns**: Command, Runs, Average, Success Rate
- **Optional columns**: Median, P95, Min, Max, Trend, Sparkline
- **Sortable**: Click any column header to sort
- **Clickable**: Click run counts to filter, click success rates to show failures
